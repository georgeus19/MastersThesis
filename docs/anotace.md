If a person wants to publish their data as linked data, it is important to find suitable terms to represent the data in existing vocabularies so that the published data are interoperable with existing linked data ecosystem and easy to consume. However, it is sometimes quite challenging to find such vocabularies and their terms for not linked data experts.

Therefore, the goal of the thesis is to try to remedy this situation by proposing a method for searching for fitting vocabulary terms based on low quality data. The general idea of the method is creating a schema of the input data and searching for vocabulary terms to fit it and optionally transforming the schema. The current result (i.e. the current schema along with the found vocabulary terms) is always visually presented to the user and they can interact with it interactively using semi-automatic recommendations or manual means for search or transformation. Once the user is satisfied, the output data based on the final schema and found terms can be generated.

The thesis should include an experimental proof-of-concept implementation of the aforementioned method and a catalog application which serves for managing vocabularies which are used by the method.
