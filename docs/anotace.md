When a person wants to publish their data as linked data, it is important to find suitable terms from existing vocabularies to represent the data so that the published data are interoperable with the existing linked data ecosystem and easy to consume. However, it is quite challenging to find such vocabularies and their terms even for linked data experts.

Therefore, the goal of the thesis is to try to remedy this situation by proposing a method for searching for fitting vocabularies and their terms based on data. The general idea of the method is creating a schema of the input data then searching for vocabularies and their terms that would fit the schema, and transforming the schema, all done iteratively. The intermediate results are presented to the user and they can interact with it using manual means or semi-automatic recommendations for search or transformation. Once the user is satisfied, the output data based on the final result can be generated.

The thesis should include a proof-of-concept application with an implementation of the aforementioned method. Apart from the method, the application ought to contain a catalog whose purpose is to provide means for adding and retrieving vocabularies and their related data so they can be used by the method.
